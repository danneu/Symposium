# Symposium

Live Demo: http://agathon.herokuapp.com

## Why?

For an educating experience, to hack around in, to practice Rails, and to gain
experience with services like Heroku and New Relic.

But I also run a large, active vBulletin forum with a large monolithic codebase
that makes it difficult for me to provide new features for my members. Ideally,
my community would be running on software that I created myself, and it's become
my long-term ambition to port my vBulletin database over to Rails.

I'm proud of this project because it's accessible to other people teaching
themselves Rails and it has a simple vision. I invite anyone interested to contribute so that we can
practice Rails together on a rather straight-forward project. I hope this
project becomes one of the many testaments of learning by just doing and
figuring things out as you go.
